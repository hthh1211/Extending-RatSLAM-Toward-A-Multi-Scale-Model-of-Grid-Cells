# Extending-RatSLAM-Toward-A-Multi-Scale-Model-of-Grid-Cells
RatSLAM is a bio-inspired simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) system. Based on continous attractor network dynamics, RatSLAM is capable of mapping by closing loops to correct odometry error.
The original RatSLAM algorithm was designed and implemented on Pioneer robots by Michael Milford and Gordon Wyeth (see RatSLAM: a hippocampal model for simultaneous localization and mapping).
This research is developed based on the original RatSLAM algorithm and aims to investigate the potential performance benefits of multiple but homogeneous parallel mapping systems in a simulated robotics context and compare it to the original ratslam.
The C++ algorithm for this research has been developed successfully and parameters are currently tuned to achieve better performance.
The test dataset will be uploaded once the research have been finished.
The code can be run in ubuntu 18.04, ROS melodic.
